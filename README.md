Approximate Pattern Matching for course INF560 -  Parallel and Distributed Computing

You can find our project report in the dna-report pdf file.


##Â Run our code

The demo.py shows you how to use our code to run it on your own files. You can compile all the files by running the compile_everything method in the demo.py file. The python method get_results enables you to run the different C files easily. If you want to run it on the same files as we did, you should download the following files on this website:
http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/
chr6.fa
chrY.fa
chr6_GL000250v2_alt.fa
chr1_KI270710v1_random.fa

then uncompress them and put them in the dna/ folder.

Then you just have to run the demo.py file which will compile everything and the results will be printed.
